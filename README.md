# Auto Layout Calculator

  1. open up Open-Me
  2. Open Me has two container views that should each be laid out to occupy vertical halves of the screen.  
  3. The top container view has a single UIText field.  Pin the text field 30 pts from the top of the container view and the standard distance from the leading and trailing edges.
  4. The bottom container has the 12 buttons of the calculator.  These buttons should all be equal sizes and touching either the edge of the container view or an adjacent button on all sides.  

  5.  The end result will be the bottom container view being a 4 * 4 grid of buttons with 0 margins.

## Extra Credit

  Make the calculator work! It's actually a bit less straight forward then you think.
